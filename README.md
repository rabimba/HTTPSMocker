## HTTP to HTTPS Proxy Tunnel
### SSL Mocker.

This is a very simple proxy implimented in Python. Which has the follwoing advantegs (which actually forced me to write it)

- Can take any HTTPS request and convert it into normal HTTP and serve the client.
- Can handle gzip compression.

## Creation reason

Mainly the following prompted me to code it

- Selenium+IE's inherent inability to properly accept self-signed certificates.
- Self-imposed Restriction of various free tools which only allow normall http scanning in their free versions.


## Procedure

- Configure clinet to use 127.0.0.1:8080
- Run this python script.(It will start a proxy server on port 127.0.0.1:8080)
- Enter any site as http instead of https

## Work in progress

- Optimizing the speed.
- Adding ability to intelligently parse secure and non-secure sites.

In case of any issues drop me a note
